                My daily driver at the moment is a 2019 MacBook Pro with an Intel Core i7 processor, 32 GB of RAM, and a
                512 GB SSD. This is attached to my <a class="link" href="https://amzn.to/3rsdIN7" target="_blank">CalDigit TS3+</a> via
                a single Thunderbolt 3 cable, which is hooked up to 2

                My peripherals of choice are:

            <p class="mb-4">
                I will also occasionally use my pair of <a href="https://amzn.to/3jpGD1z" target="_blank" class="link">AirPods Pro (2019)</a>
                if I am feeling adventurous.

            <x-use title="Alfred" link="https://www.alfredapp.com">
                I use Alfred <i>all the time</i>. It is my app launcher & switcher, my clipboard history manager, my
                workflow launcher, and my snippet expander. It is incredibly versitile and well worth the cost of the
                power pack.
            </x-use>

            <x-use title="Code editor">
                My primary IDE is whatever <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/products/#type=ide" target="_blank" class="link">Jetbrains IDE</a>
                works best for the language I am developing in at the time. On PHP projects, this is PhpStorm. For Go, Goland.
                If I am writing Java, Intellij it is. For simple throwaway scratch files and quick editing (that does not require an IDE),
                I use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" target="_blank" class="link">Microsoft VS Code</a>.
            </x-use>

            <x-use title="1Password" link="https://1password.com">
                1Password is by far the best password manager I have used to date. After years of having a cobbled together
                solution of Dropbox + KeePass + lots of frustration, I made the switch and have not looked back since. I
                pay for the family subscription.
            </x-use>

            <x-use title="Things" link="http://culturedcode.com/things/">
                Having used no proper todo app for the longest time, I finally decided to start using one after reading the
                book <a href="https://amzn.to/3k78HHz" target="_blank" class="link">Getting Things Done</a>. This has proven
                to be the best thing I could have done. And since I already up to my waste into the Apple ecosystem, I
                figured I would pick up the best todo app available.
            </x-use>

            <x-use title="Bear" link="https://bear.app">
                I use Bear for all my general note-taking. Writing Markdown comes easy to me after having done so for
                most of my programming career, and Bear makes it easy to organize the notes with their tagging feature.
            </x-use>

            <x-use title="Discord" link="https://discord.com">
                Most of my internet friends are on Discord, so that is what I use to chat with and talk to them.
            </x-use>

            <x-use title="Day One" link="https://dayoneapp.com">
                I try to write something in my journal at least once a day, and Day One is the best journaling app for
                iOS and macOS that I have found so far.

            <x-use title="In my pockets">
                The following things are <i>always</i> on me, regardless of where I am.

                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 pb-4">
                    <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3aEDacX" class="link" target="_blank">iPhone 12 Pro (Pacific Blue, 256GB)</a></li>

                </ul>
            </x-use>

            <x-use title="Travel">
                When I am out and about, I will use either my <a href="https://amzn.to/3bphiBn" class="link" target="_blank">20L Everyday Backpack (Tan)</a>,
                or <a href="https://amzn.to/3kd7DBR" class="link" target="_blank">the 30L Charcoal version</a> as a backpack. This holds
                <span title="Stay hydrated!" class="cursor-help">a nondescript 1L water bottle that I drink out of during the day</span>, as well
                as my <a href="https://amzn.to/3aFNrWd" class="link" target="_blank">Peak Design Field Pouch (Charcoal)</a> filled with cables,
                <a href="https://amzn.to/2ZzqZrg" class="link" target="_blank">a battery bank</a>, and
                <a href="https://amzn.to/3sgPnuq" class="link" target="_blank">a Samsung T5 USB-C SSD</a>.
            </x-use>

            <x-use>
                When I have to sit in transit for a while, I will take my pair of <a href="https://amzn.to/3aE2AHy" class="link" target="_blank">Sony WH1000XM3's</a>
                with me to listen to music and podcasts, and drown out the noise around me, as well as my
                <a href="https://amzn.to/3ukBgFV" class="link" target="_blank">Kindle Paperwhite</a> to read while on the go.
            </x-use>

            <x-use>
                For shorter trips, I will usually just take my <a href="https://amzn.to/3jpGD1z" target="_blank" class="link">AirPods Pro (2019)</a>
                with me. They are far more convenient than a big chunky pair of headphones, and the sound quality is not bad either.
