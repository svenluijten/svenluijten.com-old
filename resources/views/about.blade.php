                        and I am a full stack developer for the web. I got my start in the 
                        <a class="link" href="https://laravel.com">Laravel framework</a>, which I am still a big fan
                        of to this day! I try to be active in the online communities on <a href="https://twitter.com/svenuijten" class="link">Twitter</a>,
                        often <a href="https://github.com/svenluijten" class="link">contribute to open source projects and packages</a>,
                        and also <a href="https://github.com/svenluijten?tab=repositories" class="link">maintain several of my own</a>.

                My aim is to write elegant, easy-to-follow, and maintainable code, always using the best tool for the job.
                So far, I have had the privilege of working with a lot of tools and technologies, including:

            <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-3 mb-4">
                PHP, Java, Golang, Javascript, Laravel, Docker, Git, MySQL, TailwindCSS, Vue.js, React, Kubernetes,
                Spring Boot, GitHub, GitLab, Jira, PhpStorm, REST APIs, OpenAPI, Postman, StoplightIO, ...

            <p class="mb-4">
                When I have the itch, I will publish my writing on <a href="/" class="link">my blog</a>. These posts
                may range from random thoughts I had while in the shower, to articles other developers may find useful.
                I promise to try and limit the showerthoughts to <a href="https://twitter.com/svenluijten" class="link">Twitter</a>,
                though!
