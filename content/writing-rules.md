excerpt: These are some of the rules I try to stick to when doing any sort of (technical) writing.

Since starting this blog, I have tried to keep my writing as accessible to everybody as possible. This ranges from newcomers to seasoned veterans. At the start, I laid out a few rules for myself, that I would like to expand on in this blog post. 

## "Just"
Whenever possible, I avoid using the word "just". Not because I have a personal vendetta against 4-letter words, but because it degrades the person reading. Imagine reading "[...] then just attach the flux capacitor to the hibernated plomp-McGurb" in an instruction manual, but you have no idea what a "plomp-McGurb" is. That would make me feel silly, if not downright stupid. This rule can also be applied to the words "simply", "easily", and "quickly".

## Shouldn't've
To prevent confusion and promote consistency, I shy away from using contractions like "don't", "that'd", "shouldn't", "we'll", and so on. There is not some big idea behind this, I honestly thought it would make the writing more accessible (did you know that "shouldn't've" is a valid word in English? Yuck.), and it would make for a fun challenge to keep me on my toes while writing!
