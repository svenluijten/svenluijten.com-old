    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        My name's Sven Luijten, and I'm a backend PHP developer from a small town in the south of The Netherlands. Right now I'm
        doing Laravel development, and I'm (slowly but surely) learning Golang.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">My Projects</h2>
    <p>
        I've been active in the Laravel community developing packages aimed at improving the developer experience. One of my packages
        you may have come across is <a href="https://github.com/svenluijten/artisan-view" target="_blank" title="Opens in new tab">Artisan View</a>,
        a package to add a <code>make:view</code> command to your Laravel application. Feel free to poke around on
        <a href="https://github.com/svenluijten">my GitHub (svenluijten)</a> to see some of the other projects I've
        worked on and contributed to.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Get in touch</h2>
    <p>
        If you want to get in touch, feel free! The most common (and easiest) way is via
        <a href="https://twitter.com/svenluijten">my Twitter (@svenluijten)</a>. My DM's are open in case
        you want to discuss something more private.
