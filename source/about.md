Hi ðŸ‘‹ My name is Sven Luijten, and I am a backend developer specializing in the Laravel framework. I am active 
in the online community surrounding the framework, often contribute to open source projects and packages, and 
maintain several of my own, as well. My contributions and packages can be found on 
[my GitHub profile](https://github.com/svenluijten).

I currently work as a backend developer at [StuComm](https://www.stucomm.com/), where I help build apps to improve
the communication between universities and students.

My aim is always to write elegant, easy-to-follow, and maintainable code, always using the best tool for the job.
I have experience with a lot of tools and technologies, including:

> PHP, Golang, Javascript, Laravel, Lumen, Symfony, MySQL, MSSQL, OracleDB, Docker, Kubernetes, Git, GitHub, 
> GitLab, Jira, PhpStorm, REST APIs, SOAP, Postman, Linux, Ubuntu, CentOS, Windows Server, ...
